# Bynger
Bynger's goal is to let users create their own TV & Movie (content) schedules agnostic of streaming services.
Schedule and Create their own "Must See TV" lineups or Sunday night horror movie marathon.


... and hopefully, eventually, share them with their friends.

#### Notes
This project is a rewrite of an App I orginally wrote in Angular/TypeScript as a means to learn Rust on the Web.

Cheers!
